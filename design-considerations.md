# Design Constraints & Considerations

**Haloship Category**  
10,000 ft \(3048 m\) AGL apogee with commercial-off-the-shelf \(COTS\) solid or hybrid rocket propulsion system

### Motor Considerations

Must not exceed total impulse of 9,208 pound-seconds \(40,960 Newton-seconds\)  
  
All ground-started propulsion system ignition circuits/sequences shall not be "armed" until all personnel are at least 50 ft \(15 m\) away from the launch vehicle  
  
A propulsion system is considered armed if only one action \(eg an ignition signal\) must occur for the propellant\(s\) to ignite. The "arming action" is usually something \(ie a switch in series\) that enables an ignition signal to ignite the propellant\(s\)

### Electronics Considerations

#### Altitude Logging

Must carry a COTS barometric pressure altimeter, either standalone or part of COTS flight computer  
  
If using telemetry, the telemetry must report using the official altitude reporting

#### GPS
